                 Yet another persistent urban legend about time travel is the story about the "hipster time traveler". Sporting sunglasses and what appears to be a t-shirt and matching textured sweater, he was very out of place for a 1940s photograph. His clothes, glasses and modern looking camera might have been technically made in 1940, however, historians have said that it would be extremely unusual to see a man walking around dressed like that.

                  A man who had mysteriously disappeared 74 years earlier reportedly turned up in New York City in 1950 â€” yet he hadn't aged a day. The story tells of a 19th-century-looking young man possessing items of that period who is found confused in the middle of Times Square in the 1950s before being hit by a car and killed, suggesting that he had, perhaps involuntarily, time travelled about a century forwards.      </div>
